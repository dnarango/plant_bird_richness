Bird Data - need 2016 NN data
Plant Data - need to identify unknown shrubs 2016



### Format data to array including every bird species and every visit
birdsurvey<-read.csv("C:/Users/dnarango/Desktop/FINAL DATA/finalpointcounts_28march2017.csv", na.strings=".") %>%
        select(id,site, year, month,juldate, timeformat, species_format,total) %>%
        group_by(site, year, month, species_format) %>%
        summarise(total=sum(total)) %>%
        mutate(present=1) %>%
        mutate(visit=paste(year,"-",month)) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        select(-month, -year, -total) %>%
  spread(species_format, present, fill=0) %>%
        gather(species_format, present,3:100) %>%
        spread(visit, present, fill=NA) 

TO REMOVE
1. Date: August Point Counts 
a. Late in the season, too many transient birds
Fixed - 4.24.2017 - MTH
Removed sites from analysis during years in which they weren’t sampled 

2. Detection: flyovers and >50
a. Not relevant to plant data
Fixed - 4.24.2017 - MTH
3. Sites with no plant data
a. Point count surveys will be fewer and may skew detection results by adding more uncertainty and cannot be used in final models anyway
4. Birds
a. Waterbirds: Not tied to plant data
i. BEKI, CANG, LBHE,MALL, WODU, GBHE, GRHE
ii. LAGU, RBGU
b. Hawks: home ranges much larger than scale plants were sampled, not relevant to plant data
i. BLVU, TUVU, RTHA, RSHA, COHA, SSHA, OSPR, 
c. Non-breeding Migrants: 
i. BHVI, BLBW, BLPW, BTBW, CSWA, MAWA, MOWA, MYWA, NOWA, RCKI, MYWA, BTNW, CAWA, DEJU, GCTH, HETH, PAWA, SWSP, SWTH, WIFL, WTSP
d. Unlikely Breeders
i. AMRE, BAWW, BWWA, HOWA, SUTA, YTWA, VEER
e. Unknowns: Any sp. Entry, Not a real species
i. crow sp., parakeets, rooster, unknown, crga
            Fixed - 4.24.2017 - MTH - only spp included in the below list were used
